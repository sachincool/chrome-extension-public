- Shorten hybrid architecture section from 30s to 20s
- Reduce closing from 10s to 5s

---

## Narration Tips

### Voice & Delivery
- **Speak clearly** at moderate pace (not too fast)
- **Enthusiasm** without being over-the-top
- **Confidence** - you built something impressive
- **Pause** briefly between sections for editing

### Script Flexibility
- Don't read robotically - sound natural
- Ad-lib if something goes wrong (keep recording)
- Can re-record sections and splice together

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Speaking too fast (slow down!)
- ❌ Mumbling or trailing off
- ❌ Long awkward silences
- ❌ "Um", "uh", "like" filler words
- ❌ Reading feature lists verbatim

---

## Recording Workflow

### Method 1: Scripted Recording
1. Record audio first (narration only)
2. Record screen actions separately
3. Edit together in video editor
4. Add text overlays and transitions

**Pros**: Professional result, can fix mistakes  
**Cons**: More time, needs editing software

### Method 2: Live Recording
1. Practice script 3-4 times
2. Record screen + audio simultaneously
3. Minimal editing (trim start/end)

**Pros**: Faster, more authentic  
**Cons**: Harder to fix mistakes

### Recommended Approach
Hybrid: Record in 30-second segments, stitch together.

- [ ] Trim silence at start/end
- [ ] Remove mistakes/stutters

- No narration, just captions
- Record features silently
- Add text overlays explaining each step
- Background music

**Warning**: Plan A (narrated demo) is strongest for judges!

- **Test recording**: 30 minutes

- **Editing**: 30-45 minutes
- **Upload & publish**: 15 minutes

**Total**: 2-3 hours for professional result

## Final Tips

1. **Record ASAP** - don't wait until last minute
2. **Test upload** before deadline
3. **Have a friend review** if possible
4. **Keep it simple** - don't over-edit
