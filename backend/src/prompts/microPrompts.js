VERIFY THESE FACTS:

1. Company Size & Role Reality:
   - How many employees does the company have?
   - For specialized roles (CDO, Chief Data Officer, Chief AI Officer, ML Director):
     * Companies <200 employees: This role only makes sense if company IS a data/AI/tech company
     * Companies 200-500: Person needs clear technical background
     * Companies >500: More common across industries
   - For C-level in companies <100 employees: Is this person a founder or recently hired?

2. Technical Background Reality:
   - Search LinkedIn for this person's previous roles
   - For technical titles (CTO, CDO, VP Engineering, Chief AI Officer):
     * Has this person ACTUALLY worked with relevant technologies/platforms?
     * Have they ACTUALLY managed technical teams before?
     * Or are their previous roles business/operations focused?

3. Team Reality:
   - Search LinkedIn: Does this company ACTUALLY have the technical team for this role?
   - For data/AI roles: Search "ML Engineer at [company]", "Data Scientist at [company]", "Data Engineer at [company]"
   - For engineering roles: Search "Software Engineer at [company]" in relevant domains
   - Report the actual numbers you find

4. Industry Reality:
   - What industry is this company actually in?
   - Does this role make sense for this industry at this company size?
